<h1> About Me//Ileyna Whitfield</h1> <h1 style color:yellow>About Me//Ileyna Whitfield</h1> <p> I go to Kentridge High School for those that dont know
  and next year will be my last year of High School.
  I love spending most of my time shopping, hanging out with friends, or drawing.
  I like to have a theme for everything including clothes and the way my room is set up.
  I love makeup and most of my family thinks i'm materialstic which is fine with me:).
