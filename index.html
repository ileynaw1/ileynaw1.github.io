    <h1 style=" color:yellow;">About Me//Ileyna Whitfield</h1>
    <p> I go to Kentridge High School for those that dont know
        and next year will be my last year of High School.
        I love spending most of my time shopping, hanging out with friends, or drawing.
        I like to have a theme for everything including clothes and the way my room is set up.
        I love makeup and most of my family thinks i'm materialstic which is fine with me:).</p>
