    <h1 style=" color:yellow;">About Me//Ileyna Whitfield</h1>
    <p> I go to Kentridge High School for those that dont know
        and next year will be my last year of High School.
        I love spending most of my time shopping, hanging out with friends, or drawing.
        I like to have a theme for everything including clothes and the way my room is set up.
        I love makeup and most of my family thinks i'm materialstic which is fine with me:).</p>

      Info On My Website
    </h1>
    <p> By making my wbsite accesbile to users i set the website to public so that way everyone can see it. What i found cool about other people's
      websites was some would have cool different texts and backgrounds. They did it by looking at HTML images and changing the font for the texts.
      What im most proud of learning is being able to understand the language of html and game coding.</p>
